# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm kostchei - coding with the LLMs! ðŸ¤– Zero knowledge of code, just the LLMs helping me build cool stuff.

## ðŸš€ Live Applications

Here are my deployed Azure Static Web Apps:

### ðŸŽ² D&D Tools & Encounters
- **[DnD Encounters 24](https://green-mud-0d844ea00.azurestaticapps.net)** - D&D encounter generator and tools
- **[Descriptors App](https://blue-mushroom-06e8ed300.azurestaticapps.net)** - Character and scene descriptors
- **[Alternative Descriptors](https://happy-island-044244700.azurestaticapps.net)** - More descriptor tools

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Build

Most of my projects are D&D-related tools and utilities, built entirely with AI assistance. From encounter generators to character creation tools, it's all about making tabletop gaming more fun and accessible!
